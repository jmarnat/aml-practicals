The first step is to write a simple problem with a few data:
a set $X$ of points in $D$ dimensions.
We want to minimize the radius $r$ of a ball $D = \{r,c\}$ with a center $c$ such that :
$$ \forall x \in X, \sum_{d = 1}^D (X[i,d] - c[d]) ^ 2 \leq r ^ 2$$

The first result that we get with $X = \{(0,0),(2,0),(0,2),(1,1)\}$ is $C = [1,1]$ and $r = 1.41 = \sqrt{2}$. Which is correct.
